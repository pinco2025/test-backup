Since 1 is a rational number, every element is related to itself.\nSymmetry : For all $x, y$ in $R$, if $x = \\alpha y$ for some rational $\\alpha$, then $y = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}x$. However, if $\\alpha = 0$, then $\\frac{1}{\\alpha}$ is undefined, and therefore, $B$ doesn't satisfy symmetry.\nTransitivity : If $x = \\alpha y$ and $y = \\beta z$ for some rational numbers $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, then $x = (\\alpha \\beta)z$. Since the product of rational numbers is rational, if $x$ is related to $y$ and $y$ is related to $z$, then $x$ is related to $z$.\nTherefore, $B$ is not an equivalence relation on $R$ since it does not satisfy the symmetry property.\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is\nOption B : Statement I is true, Statement II is false.",

If $E_a$ were zero, every collision would result in a reaction regardless of temperature, meaning the reaction would be instantaneous and independent of temperature (since $k = Ae^{-E_a/RT}$).
